        <h1>Artemis Generation ADC ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ</h1>
        <p>What is the Artemis Generation ADC?</p>
    
        <p>The Artemis Generation App Development Challenge was a competition hosted by NASA that I took part of in 2021. This competition consisted of NASA giving my team, which consisted of me and 6 other people,
            a dataset representing coordinates of the South Pole of the moon. Our objective was to create a simulation that would map the coordinates that were given to us.
        </p>
        </p>
    
        <p>My role in this project was to process a csv file with <b>11 million data points</b> and create a rough texture for the moon's surface and a simulated sun that could be seen from your current location on the moon. I first processed the data to 
            get the most important information, and then mapped it in a 3D space based on elevation. Using this map and Blender, I was able to create an asset that represented the different elevations of the moon. My teammate
            then took this asset and put it into Unity, where we were able to create a simulation of a robot that was traversing the moon's surface. Using the robot's current position, I also was able to dynamically 
            adjust the position of the sun. 
        </p>

        <p>This project won my team a spot as one of the <b>7 finalists nationwide</b>. We were able to present our project to NASA, which was a very cool experience. This project was a great experience
            for me, as I was able to work with a team of people who were all passionate about space and technology. I was able to learn a lot about data sceince and 3D modeling, and I was able to learn how to work with a team of people
            who all had different skills and backgrounds.
