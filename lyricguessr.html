        <h1>LyricGuessr ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ</h1>
        <p>What is LyricGuessr?</p>
    
        <p>LyricGuessr was a passion project that I was able to actualize via the Google CSSI program. I've always had a vested interest in music and their artists, and I wanted to create a platform
            that tests someone on how diehard of a fan they were for a certain artist. The game is simple: the user is given a snippet of lyrics from a song, and they have to guess the song title and artist.
            Coding it, especially as one of the first real projects that I tackled, was not as easy.
        </p>
    
        <p>LyricGuessr consisted of applying the front-end skills I learned in high school and learning the back-end skills I needed during the development process. The most challenging portion of this project was 
            connecting the user's Spotify account to the website, where the website would then choose a random top artist and song from said artist. This consisted of using Spotify's OAuth. When I was making this website, Spotify did not 
            internally have lyrics for an artist yet, so I also needed to use the MusixMatch API to get the lyrics for the song. Finally, I used local data storage to make sure that users could retain their score between refreshes.
        </p>

        <p>Overall, this is one of the projects I am most proud of. Although I didn't do anything crazy with this project, it was still something that made me very proud when I was able to show my friends and encourage them to play my game. 
            This project helped me realize what I wanted out of my career.
